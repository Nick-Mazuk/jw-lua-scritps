# Library

This repository includes several pre-made Lua functions that you can use in your code. That way, you can write better scripts, faster.

```lua
-- load each library module you'll use
local library = require("library.file_name") -- no path, no ".lua"

-- run a library function
library.function_name()
```

Subsequent pages detail the exact details of the library. If you wish to contribute to the standard library, create a pull request.

## Documenting library functions

The docs for the individual functions are automatically created from the multiline comments you use in your code. For instance…

```lua
--[[
% stem_sign

This is useful for many x,y positioning fields in Finale that mirror +/-
based on stem direction.

@ entry (FCNoteEntry)
: (number) 1 if upstem, -1 otherwise
]]
```

…Produces the following documentation…

### stem_sign

```lua
note_entry.stem_sign(entry)
```

This is useful for many x,y positioning fields in Finale that mirror +/-
based on stem direction.

| Input | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `entry` | `FCNoteEntry` |  |

| Output type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `number` | 1 if upstem, -1 otherwise |

---

As you can see, the comments are very easy to write and produce readable, searchable documentation. Clearly documenting any functions you write is almost as valuable as the code itself.
